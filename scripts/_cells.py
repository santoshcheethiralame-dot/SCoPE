"""Shared loading for the CPU runners: one record per wrong case of a cell.

Families come in four modes. ``designed`` targets the planted carriers (designed.jsonl, else
retrofitted from the recipe); ``behavioral`` targets the responsible sets the model actually
exhibits — leave-one-out causal singletons from roles.jsonl plus the jointly-necessary pairs the
leave-two-out probe recorded in coalition_proof.jsonl; ``fixer`` targets repair — the passages
whose lone removal restores the correct answer, the set a debugger actually wants; ``mscs``
targets the enumerated minimal sufficient sets from mscs.jsonl (the run_natural_mscs artifact) —
the exact object the guarantee is about. An empty family means the case is uncoverable and is
kept, not dropped; cases a mode has no record for are skipped.
