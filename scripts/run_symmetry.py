"""Measure the approximate-symmetry rate on run cells — CPU only, no model.

For every wrong case, find near-duplicate passage pairs (token Jaccard) and report how often a
case carries one at all and how often one touches the responsible candidates — the empirical
frequency of the regime where Theorem 5 says a single responsible set is non-identifiable.
Members come from roles.jsonl (causal or salient passages); when the cell has an mscs.jsonl,
the enumerated minimal-sufficient union is reported as a second, sharper member set. The full
threshold curve is printed so no operating point is chosen after seeing the data.
